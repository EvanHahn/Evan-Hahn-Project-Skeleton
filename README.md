Evan Hahn's project skeleton
============================

This is what my directory looks like when I start building a web front-end project.

The big stuff it contains are as follows:

* Components from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* CSS with [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)
* JavaScript with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* Automatically updating builds with [SnackWrap](https://github.com/EvanHahn/SnackWrap)

It also has some littler things:

* Add `js` to `<html>` tag if JavaScript is enabled
* [Stylus templates](https://github.com/EvanHahn/Evan-Hahn-Project-Skeleton/blob/master/stylus/templates.stylus) for common tasks
* Wide window versus narrow window, with JavaScript to switch between them (for mobile layouts, and intentionally not a `@media` query)
* JavaScript minification with the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
* Local storage API
* JSON included if not available

Enjoy!
